# Hello There

I am a college student currently taking a Bachelor in Science Degree in Computer
Engineering at [Pamantasan Lungsod ng San Pablo][DLSP]. I am interested in many
different types of technology but I have keen eyes for web technologies and low level tech.

* I am currently learning C++
* I am currently busy studying in College and following our Programming Curriculum.

You can find me rambling about random things in my [blog].
